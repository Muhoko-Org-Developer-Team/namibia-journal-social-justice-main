                            All scholarly articles should be based on rigorous, original research. Articles should
                            significantly extend
                            knowledge of and advance debate on social justice. Articles must contribute to basic social
                            justice
                            principles
                            of access, equality, rights and participation. The submissions must engage critically with
                            the issues that
                            promote or impede social justice. The articles should seek new ways and insights for
                            understanding problems
                            under investigation. The journal seeks to encourage interdisciplinary research and will
                            therefore encourage
                            collaboration across disciplinary boundaries.

                        <p><strong>Authorship: </strong>Authors must ensure that the work submitted was written by them.
                            All authors who made a significant contribution to the article should be acknowledged. The
                            journal will not publish articles with guest authors who have not contributed significantly
                            towards the authorship of the article. </p>
                        <p><strong>Conflicts of interests: </strong>All conflicts of interests and funders must be
                            declared. </p>
                        <p><strong>Plagiarism: </strong>The journal will not publish articles that have been wholly,
                            partially or self-plagiarised. All data, words, phrases, concepts and ideas of others must
                            therefore be duly credited. </p>
                        <p><strong>Harm: </strong>The journal will not publish work based on research that has caused
                            harm to vulnerable groups, animals and the environment. </p>
                        <p><strong>Simultaneous submissions: </strong>The journal will not publish work that has already
                            been published or submitted elsewhere for publication. It is the author’ responsibility to
                            inform the editorial collective of such simultaneous submissions. </p>
                        <p><strong>Retraction: </strong>Where gross errors are found in the work, the journal, in

                            the authors and the reviewers will not be made known to the parties involved. Articles will
                            initially be reviewed by the editorial collective to assess their suitability for
                            publication. Once a determination with regard to suitability for publication is made,
                            articles will be submitted to reviewers. Reviewers will be required to review the work
                            fairly, timeously and confidentially. The reviewers should refrain from unjustified
                            criticism, personal attacks and derogatory or hostile comments. Where necessary they should
                            make very concrete suggestions for improvement. </p>
                        <p><strong>Copyright: </strong>Once the journal has agreed to publish an article, copy right
                            will be ceded to the journal.</p>

                            reviews of recently published individually authored books or edited volumes that deal with
                            issues of social justice and are grounded on the basic principles of social justice namely,
                            access, equity, rights, and participatory parity. Reviews should engage on the subject

                            certain claims or analyses in the books. Reviews should demonstrate thoughtful engagement

                            reviews of books on Namibia, but we also welcome reviews of books covering social justice
